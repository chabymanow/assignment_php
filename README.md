## Assignment 2 ##
----
This repo was created to demonstrate the school assignment. The assignment is the planning and preparation of a data story.

This repo contains the PHP-based website using this database, without the database. Although maybe I should include that as well.

I didn't spend much time on the design, it wasn't an issue. It only has a minimal **[TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/)** CSS for simplicity.
The database login data is not included in the file, you can configure it as you like.

The variables are:
* $username
* $password

Yes, it wasn't overcomplicated.
